                    <p>The Netflix original series GLOW has one of the more original premises in recent TV history:
                        It chronicles the life of a fledgling professional wrestling promotion called the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,
                        as various aspiring actresses and generally women down on their luck audition 
                        and agree to take a stab at a wholly new field.

                <li>Parks and Recreation</li>
                    <p>What sets Parks and Recreation apart from other comedies is that it’s absolutely sincere and free of cynicism. 
                        It’s clear that even if the characters rib each other, there’s genuine love between them. 
                        But yes, the show is hilarious, and Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope is one of the seminal sitcom characters of our time.</p>

                <li>Stranger Things</li>
                    <p>The 80s-set mystery thriller is equal parts It, Stand by Me, 
                        and The Goonies as it mashes up the creepy atmosphere of a Stephen King novel 
                        with compelling characters and a strong narrative drive. 
                        The true test of Stranger Things is whether the show works without 
                        the nostalgia-inducing 80s setting, and the answer is yes.</p>

                <li>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</li>
                    <p>Star Wars: The Clone Wars takes place during the title conflict, 
                        a time when Anakin Skywalker and his fellow Jedi Knights led 
                        the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatists’ New Droid Army. 
                        It’s notable for greatly expanding (and improving on) 
                        Anakin Skywalker’s backstory before he took on the persona of Darth Vader.</p>
